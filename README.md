# JLogoProgram
Program developed using the Java programming language, it provides an implementation of the Logo program.
A Logo program aims to create a set of segments (straight or curved) within a drawing area. 
Running a program causes a cursor to move, generating an underlying drawing. 
The area where the product design is made consists of a portion of the top having finished dimensions (base, height). 
The coordinate (0,0) indicates the lower left point of the piano. 
The central location (called home) has coordinate (base / 2, height / 2). 
The cursor has a number of attributes such as position, color direction etc.
The movement of the cursor is defined by means of a program which consists of a list of instructions, 
such as moving forward, backward, the possibility to rotate the cursor and many other commands. 
During the movement of the cursor, if the pen is attached to the sheet, it generates Segments,
and if the Segments are consecutive and return to the starting point, these form a closed area / Polygon. 
The developed project represents the Logo Program using the object-oriented programming field using 
the Java programming language. It has no view but the default implementation, so only the code representing the Logo program.
